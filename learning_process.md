# Learning Process 

### Feynman Technique

Sir Richard Feynman was a Noble prize winner theoretical physicist. Being a great learner he was also an excellent 
teacher of the subject. His teaching philosophy can be used across domains. 
The philosophy of the technique was quite simple as a good teacher would keep it. It's "If you want to understand 
something well, EXPLAIN it." 

It's elementary that explaining the concept improves your understanding of the concept. Richard Feynman had mastered it
and that's why people referred to him as the 'great explainer'.
Feynman said this - 'The first principle is not to fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool'. This makes a lot 
of sense for me as I always assumed that I know of a concept until I explain it. 

Let's dive into it step-wise - 
1. Take a piece of paper and write the concept's name on the top
2. Explain the concept in a very simple language
3. Identify any area in which you lag and go back to basics and then review it
4. look for any complicated terms/subconcepts and try to simplify it

### Learning how to learn - Barbara Oakley

Barbara Oakley's TEDx talk, "Learning How to Learn," explores effective learning strategies and techniques to improve one's
ability to grasp new concepts and retain information. She begins by sharing her personal experience of struggling with math
and science subjects, which eventually led her to develop insights into the learning process.

Oakley highlights the two modes of thinking that our brains employ: the focused mode and the diffuse mode. The focused mode
involves concentrated effort and deep thinking, while the diffuse mode works more passively in the background, allowing ideas
to incubate and connect subconsciously.

To enhance learning, she emphasizes the importance of employing both modes in a balanced manner. She introduces the concept
of "chunking," which involves breaking complex information into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier for the
brain to process and store. Additionally, she advocates the use of metaphor and analogy as powerful tools to understand new
subjects by connecting them to familiar concepts.

Furthermore, Oakley explains the significance of regular practice and repetition to strengthen memory and promote long-term
retention. She introduces the "Pomodoro Technique," which involves short bursts of focused study followed by breaks to avoid
mental fatigue.

Overall, Barbara Oakley's talk provides valuable insights into effective learning strategies, encouraging viewers to embrace
a diverse set of techniques, leverage both focused and diffuse thinking, and adopt a growth mindset when approaching
challenging subjects. By employing these techniques, individuals can become more efficient learners and overcome obstacles
in their educational journey.

### Learn anything in 20 hours 

In his TEDx talk titled "The First 20 Hours -- How to Learn Anything," Josh Kaufman shares his insights into rapid skill
acquisition. He challenges the notion that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill and instead proposes a more efficient
approach.

Kaufman introduces the concept of "the first 20 hours," which he believes is the critical time needed to gain a basic level
of proficiency in any new skill. He emphasizes the importance of focused and deliberate practice during these initial hours.
To illustrate his point, he demonstrates his personal journey of learning how to play the ukulele.

The key principles he advocates for effective learning are:

1. Deconstructing the skill into smaller sub-skills
2. Learning the most important sub-skills first
3. Removing barriers to practice
4. Pre-committing to at least 20 hours of focused learning.

By following this approach, Kaufman argues that learners can quickly acquire enough competence to enjoy the process of skill
acquisition and build a solid foundation for further improvement. He inspires viewers to embrace the challenge of learning 
new skills and to dispel the myth that it takes an impractical amount of time to become proficient in a new domain.

### Question 5

In this video by Improvement Pill, the concept of the "Locus Rule" is explained to help individuals stay motivated. The "Locus 
Rule" is centered around the idea of having an internal locus of control, which means believing that you have the power to 
influence and control the outcomes in your life. By adopting this mindset, you can maintain motivation and take charge of your 
actions to achieve your goals.

Three key points from the video:

1. Internal Locus of Control: Understand that you have the ability to impact your life's direction through your choices and 
actions. Avoid falling into a victim mentality where external factors are blamed for your lack of progress. Instead, focus 
on what you can do to move forward.

2. Set Specific Goals: Clearly define your goals and break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. Having clear objectives 
will give you a sense of purpose and direction, making it easier to stay motivated and track your progress.

3. Develop Positive Habits: Build habits that align with your goals and support your growth. Consistency is crucial in 
maintaining motivation, so create routines that reinforce your efforts and help you stay on track even during challenging 
times.
